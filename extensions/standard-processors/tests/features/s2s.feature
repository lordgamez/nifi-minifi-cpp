Feature: Sending data from MiNiFi-C++ to NiFi using S2S protocol
  In order to transfer data inbetween NiFi and MiNiFi flows
  As a user of MiNiFi
  I need to have RemoteProcessGroup flow nodes

  Scenario: A MiNiFi instance produces and transfers data to a NiFi instance via s2s
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${scenario_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the to_nifi

    And a NiFi container is set up
    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "nifi" flow
    And in the "nifi" flow the "success" relationship of the from-minifi node is connected to the PutFile
    And PutFile's success relationship is auto-terminated in the "nifi" flow
    And PutFile's failure relationship is auto-terminated in the "nifi" flow

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then in the "nifi" container a single file with the content "test" is placed in the "/tmp/output" directory in less than 90 seconds
    And the Minifi logs do not contain the following message: "ProcessSession rollback" after 1 seconds

  Scenario: A MiNiFi instance produces and transfers a large data file to a NiFi instance via s2s
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "this is a very long file we want to send by site-to-site" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${scenario_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the to_nifi

    And a NiFi container is set up
    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "nifi" flow
    And in the "nifi" flow the "success" relationship of the from-minifi node is connected to the PutFile
    And PutFile's success relationship is auto-terminated in the "nifi" flow
    And PutFile's failure relationship is auto-terminated in the "nifi" flow

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then in the "nifi" container a single file with the content "this is a very long file we want to send by site-to-site" is placed in the "/tmp/output" directory in less than 90 seconds
    And the Minifi logs do not contain the following message: "ProcessSession rollback" after 1 seconds

  Scenario: Zero length files are transfered between via s2s if the "drop empty" connection property is false
    # "drop empty" is only supported with yaml config
    Given a MiNiFi CPP server with yaml config
    And a GenerateFlowFile processor with the "File Size" property set to "0B"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${scenario_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFile processor is connected to the to_nifi

    And a NiFi container is set up
    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"

    And PutFile's success relationship is auto-terminated in the "nifi" flow
    And PutFile's failure relationship is auto-terminated in the "nifi" flow

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then in the "nifi" container at least one empty file is placed in the "/tmp/output" directory in less than 90 seconds

  Scenario: Zero length files are not transfered between via s2s if the "drop empty" connection property is true
    # "drop empty" is only supported with yaml config
    Given a MiNiFi CPP server with yaml config
    And a GenerateFlowFile processor with the "File Size" property set to "0B"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${scenario_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFile processor is connected to the to_nifi
    And the connection going to to_nifi has "drop empty" set
